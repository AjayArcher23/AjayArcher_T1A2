## Overview 
This is a portfolio website which presents myself as a developer and an IT professional. The website is aimed at a hypothetical employer searching for a skilled dev and/or IT professional 

## Website Components 

### Header 
The header contains a navigation bar with three links to an About Page, Services Page and a Blog Page. It also has a smiley face logo which links back to the Home Page. The Header has been styled so that the nav items are in the middle with the logo above on Mobile devices, otherwise the logo will move to the left side and the navbar items will move to the right side. All Header items will change color when hovered over. The logo has been animated so that it rotates when hovered over.

### Footer  
The footer contains links to Github, Linkedin and Instagram. There is also Contact information, presenting a mock phone number and address. The footer has been styled in a responsive way which changes the way which the social links are presented depending on what device your viewing it on.

## Design  

### Colours 

I chose to use the colours Jade Green, a warm yellow and a vibrant orange. The yellow and orange bring a sunset to mind and makes the site appear bright and happy. The moody green contrasts that and draws attention to key features.
